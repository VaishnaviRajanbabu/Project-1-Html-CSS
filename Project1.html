        <h2>NATURE</h2>
        <p> 
           Nature refers to the interaction between the physical surroundings around us and the life within it like atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, flora, fauna, and humans.
           Nature is called 'Mother Nature' because just like our mother, she is always nurturing us with all our needs.

            The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. Things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies and much more are part of nature.
            Nature is often seen by humans as natural resources. People cut down trees, mine ores, and grow crops
